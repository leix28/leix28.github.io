### About Me

I'm an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com). My research convers a wide range of topics in natural language processing and machine learning. 
Recently, my work has been focused on the application of large language models in the medical domain. 
My long-term objective is to pave the way for robust and deployable LLM applications.

I got my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu) in 2023, and B.Eng. from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn).

### Selected Projects


##### Robustness of Text Classifiers

With deployment of large language models, the security and robustness of these models have become a real issue. In this project, we thoroughly explore how well text classifiers can handle attacks from different angles. We developed [R&R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08453.pdf) and [SP-Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17196.pdf) for traditional transformer-based text classifiers. We also proposed [AToP/BToP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05239.pdf) attacks for prompt-based language models. And we're putting effort into defending against these attacks with [In Situ Augmentation](/misc/paper/ICONIP_fibber_defense.pdf). 

##### Synthetic Tabular Generation
In this project, we aim to generate synthetic tabular data, which can help remove the barriers in data sharing. We started with an LSTM-based [TGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11264.pdf) model, then further improved it by proposing [CTGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00503.pdf).
