### About Me

I'm an ML researcher at [OpenEvidence](https://www.openevidence.com), on a mission to revolutionize healthcare through AI. 🏥✨

I believe LLMs have the potential to transform how we augment human capabilities. My research focuses on building more reliable LLM systems that can genuinely support critical decision-making.

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at [Amazon AWS](https://www.amazon.science/author/lei-xu), where I pioneered LLMs for medical scribing.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu) in 2023, researching language model robustness and synthetic data, and my B.Eng. from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn). 

### News
